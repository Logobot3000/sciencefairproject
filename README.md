# sciencefairproject
I decided to make a website for my science fair project, so here it is.
I have this as a way to get out of making a tri-fold board and also making my school science fair a little more creative.
Navigate the page as you want, but please note the issues and document them. It's still in development, so please make sure it's at least bearable.
