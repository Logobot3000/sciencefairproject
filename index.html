                                Rust is an iron oxide that is created from exposure to oxygen and water. Over time, oxygen combines with iron at an atomic level, forming the rust and weakening the actual iron the rust is formed on. (Pollick, "What is Rust?") Oxygen (O) in the form of air or water takes electrons from the original iron (Fe) to form Iron III Oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). (McGraw Hill Education, 593) Since rust is an iron oxide, rust is a form of combustion. The rate at which this forms can be dependent on the environment it is in. This can be accelerated by amounts of water, especially if the water has a high amount of electrolytes. (Vork, "How does Rust Spread?") There is another factor as well- temperature. Atoms, irons, and molecules have to collide to react, and because they are moving at a faster rate when heated, the more they collide, reacting faster, and vice versa. (McGraw Hill Education, 596) Since water expodites the corrosion, how can it be slowed? Well, you could paint the iron, or alloy it with other metals, like in steel. (Vedantu, "Methods of Prevention of Rusting of Iron") Now knowing how rust is formed and how it works, does it matter? Does it have any pros or cons? The effects of rusting mainly includes damage to the original material. This can be a problem in airplanes or vehicles, electronics, and museum artifacts. (Camfil, "What are the Effects of Corrosion?") Overall, rust is an iron oxide formed from interaction between oxygen and moisture on iron. The oxidization process can be sped up by water or temperature, and prevented by layers of coating or alloying the metal.

                                Iron rust, or iron III oxide, is created from exposure to oxygen and water. "Over time, the oxygen combines with the metal at an atomic level, forming a new compound..." "...and weakening the bonds of the metal itself." (Pollick, "What is Rust?")<br><br>Since rust is an oxide that is made from exposure to oxygen and moisture, rust is a chemical change, combustion to be precise. How does this change in other environments, and how can the time to rust be manipulated? "...the rate of rusting is usually slight and slow but it is accelerated by water, especially if the water has a high concentration of electrolytes." (Vork, "How does Rust Spread?")<br><br>Since water expodites the corrosion process, can the oxidization be prevented? "...keep iron from corrosion by painting it. The layers of paint resist oxygen and water..." "...[also] iron alloying with metals..." (Vedantu, "Methods of Prevention of Rusting of Iron.")<br><br>Now knowing how rust is formed and how it works, how can you control time to oxidize, and hiw to prevent it, does rust even have any pros or cons? "...effects of corrosion may include damage to commercial airplanes or cehicle electronics..." "...damage to server/rooms or data centres..." [and] "Damage to museum artefacts..." (Camfil. "What are the Effects of Corrosion")<br><br>Oxidization is a form of decay, slowly breaking down the original material. Take the Statue of Liberty, originally brown copper, and now immortallized with a bluish-green color due to oxidization and weathering. Now that we know what happens with copper: what happens with iron? "Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) from the air takes electrons from the iron (Fe) to form Iron III Oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)." (McGraw Hill Education, 593)<br><br>The iron is oxidized and the oxygen is reduced. We have the iron background research now. But what about environments? "The collision model states that atoms, irons, and molecules must collide in order to react." "Because the particles are moving faster at higher temperatures, they collide, reacting faster." (McGraw Hill Education, 596) This shows that the higher temperature an environment is, the faster it will react. And since we know from earlier that more oxygen and moisture also is a faster reaction, we can make assumptions like: On a nice day at noon, rust will be normal. On a hot rainy day, rust will form faster. In a fridge, rust wil form slower, etc.
